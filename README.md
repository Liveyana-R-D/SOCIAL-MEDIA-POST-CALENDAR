##DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

✅ Task 1: Social Media Post Calendar
Description (500+ words):
This task focuses on building a 30-day social media post calendar for a brand — in this case, Creamy Hub, an online cake ordering and delivery service. The aim is to provide a detailed, visually planned calendar that outlines daily social media posts for a full month. The calendar includes post captions, hashtags, image ideas, and objectives aligned with the brand’s voice and marketing goals.
Social media is one of the most powerful tools for building brand presence online. This calendar is designed to ensure consistency, engagement, and value-driven content throughout the month. Each post is planned with a specific purpose — whether to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to the website, promote a specific product or offer, celebrate a festival or occasion, or simply entertain and engage the followers.
The captions are crafted to align with the tone of the brand, which is friendly, inviting, and cheerful — just like cakes! The hashtags are chosen based on keyword research and trending tags in the bakery and food niche. Image ideas are suggested to align with each caption and include professional cake photos, customer testimonials, behind-the-scenes shots, contests, celebration posts, and more.
The deliverable for this task is an Excel or Google Sheet format post calendar that includes:
•	Date
•	Caption
•	Hashtags
•	Image/Visual Idea
•	Platform (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
•	Post Type (Reel, Story, Carousel, etc.)
•	Objective (Engagement, Sales, Awareness)
This document not only serves as a content plan but can be used as a collaboration tool across design and social teams. It helps in maintaining content consistency, managing time more effectively, and aligning with marketing campaigns. This structured planning avoids last-minute chaos and helps achieve the brand’s digital goals smoothly.
